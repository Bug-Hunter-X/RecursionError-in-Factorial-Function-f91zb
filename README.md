# RecursionError in Factorial Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in Python's recursive functions: improper handling of the base case, leading to a `RecursionError`. The `factorial_bug.py` file contains the erroneous code, which causes infinite recursion when called with negative numbers. The `factorial_solution.py` demonstrates the corrected code.
